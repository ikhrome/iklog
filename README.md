# Blog on Spring WebMVC
Java Spring-based web application for online blogs.
It's just a test for future projects. Spring is awesome and powerful, but to understand this, I need to do something small.

## Thoughts and plans:
[x] Buy more beer
[x] Add all dependencies in Gradle project
[x] Include WebMVC and make template in `.tag` file
[x] Say _Hello_ from Spring to users!
[] Include Hibernate
    [] Make models and DA objects
    [] Create `@Bean` for Hibernate and SessionManager in `ApplicationConfiguration.java`
